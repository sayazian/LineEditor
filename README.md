Line editor
Write a simple word processor that will accept text and commands as input.  The commands it should respond to are:
Substitute/oldstring/newstring/	Type #
Copy #	Paste 
Locate/string/	Insert #
Delete #	Replace #
Move #	Quit
The file will consist of up to 100 lines.  The program should be able to open an existing file or create a new one.  It should keep track of where the user is in the file at any time.  Each command is followed by a number which indicates the number of lines (The current line & those following) upon which the command should act.  Each command should operate on the specified line or lines of the file.  A detailed explanation of each command follows: 
Substitute/oldstring/newstring/
Substitute newstring for every occurrence of oldstring in the current line.  Issue a message if oldstring does not appear in the current line.  Print the changed line.
Type #
Print the contents of the next # lines, including the current one.  Don't print blank spaces at the end of a line.  The current line should be the last line typed.
Copy #
Copy the next # lines, including the current one, to a temporary storage area.  The current line should not change.
Paste
Copy the contents of the temporary storage area to a position between the current line and the line following the current line.  The current line should become the last line pasted.
Locate/string/
Find the next occurance of string and make the line containing it the current line.  If string does not occur anywhere in the file after the current line, issue a message and don't change the current line.  Then print the current line.
